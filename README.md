Cleaning of data feat. TA Hero Gunawan
## Visualisation of Data

Visualsation of Data was done with mostly hvplot, however the imported library Altair was used as it provided a more efficient way of combined plots together.
Documentation of Altair can be found [here.](https://pypi.org/project/altair/)

For example, bar graphs can easily be made with negative values containing different colours to notate whether the value was negative or positive.
