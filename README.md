## Project Goals

Our Project goal was to analyse trends using Bitcoin liquidation data. 
We would examine the relationships between liquidations, price & futures data, volume and use technical analysis to attempt to arrive at reliable market signals.

## Visualisation of Data

### Process of Visualisation

Visualsation of Data was done with mostly hvplot, however the imported library Altair was used as it provided a more efficient way of combined plots together.
Documentation of Altair can be found [here.](https://pypi.org/project/altair/)

The installation is simply 

<code> 
    
    pip install altair
  
<code/>
